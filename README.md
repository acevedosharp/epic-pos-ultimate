If you want to use this software you keep in mind the following:

1. Install MariaDB on your machine and make sure to have it on automatic start-up.
2. In resources/application.properties is where you can configure you database url, user and time zone.
3. You can change your store icon in resources/images/store_logo.png and store_logo_icon.png the latter being a square version of it.
4. Finally, in main/kotlin/com/acevedosharp/views/helpers/RecipePrintingService.kt in the printRecipe method you can configure what you want your recipes to display and the name of your printer.

Feel free to create an issue if you find one, I might fix it!
